# Library-management-system-oops
A Python-based Library Management System using OOP concepts to manage books, members, and transactions efficiently with features like book issue, return, and record maintenance.

# 📚 Library Management System (OOP Based)

This project is a **Python-based Library Management System** developed using **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts.  
It helps manage books, members, and book transactions easily and efficiently.

---

## 💡 Project Overview
The system allows a librarian or user to:
- ➕ Add, update, or delete book records  
- 👥 Register and manage members  
- 📖 Issue and return books  
- 🔍 Check availability of books  

---

## 🧠 OOP Concepts Used
- **Class and Object:** Represent books, members, and library  
- **Encapsulation:** Protect and manage data using methods  
- **Inheritance:** Reuse and extend class functionalities  
- **Polymorphism:** Perform similar actions in different ways  

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Language:** Python  
- **Concepts:** Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)  
- **Optional:** File handling or database for data storage  

---

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Install **Python 3.x** on your system.  
2. Download or clone this repository.  
3. Open the project folder in **VS Code**, **Spyder**, or any Python IDE.  
4. Run the main file (for example: `main.py`).  

---

## 🎯 Objective
To automate library operations and demonstrate how **OOP principles** can be applied in real-world software development using Python.

---

## 💡 Future Improvements
- 💰 Add fine calculation for late book returns  
- 🖥️ Create a graphical interface using Tkinter or web framework  
- 🔐 Add admin login and generate reports
