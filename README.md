# Library-management-system-oops
A Python-based Library Management System using OOP concepts to manage books, members, and transactions efficiently with features like book issue, return, and record maintenance.

#  Library Management System (OOP Based)

This project is a **Python-based Library Management System** developed using **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts.  
It helps manage books, members, and book transactions easily and efficiently.

##  OOP Concepts Used
- **Class and Object:** Represent books, members, and library  
- **Encapsulation:** Protect and manage data using methods  
- **Inheritance:** Reuse and extend class functionalities  
- **Polymorphism:** Perform similar actions in different ways  

---

## Technologies Used
- **Language:** Python  
- **Concepts:** Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)  
- **Optional:** File handling or database for data storage  
 

---

##  Objective
To automate library operations and demonstrate how **OOP principles** can be applied in real-world software development using Python.

---

##  Future Improvements
-  Add fine calculation for late book returns  
-  Create a graphical interface using Tkinter or web framework  
-  Add admin login and generate reports
